        <p>Functional programming has many of its roots from Lambda Calculus <InlineMath math="\lambda"></InlineMath>.
            Therefore its good to have a grasp of Lambda Calculus originally defined by Alonzo Church around 1930. It is
            a formal system to describe the most basic ways that operators or functions can be combined to form other
            operators (Hindley et al, 2008). </p>
