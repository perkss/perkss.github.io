        <p>an interest rate defines the amount of money a borrower promises to pay the lender</p>

        <p>Factor is credit risk of borrower the worse the borrower the higher the rate the extra amount for credit risk is added and known as the credit spread
        </p>

        <p>Interest rate often written in basis points where one basis point is 0.01%
        </p>

        <h4>Treasury Rates</h4>
        <p>the rate an investor earns on treasury bills and treasury bonds
            Instruments used by governments to borrow in own currency
            Assumed that no worries on default for developed countries
            Regarded as risk free
        </p>

        <h4>Overnight Rates</h4>

        <p>banks are required to maintain a certain amount of cash known as reserve with central bank
            At the end of the day some financial institutions have surplus funds and others require more leading to borrowing and lending overnight. In US central bank is fed and is used for the broker and this is called federal funds rate.
            In uk the rate is called SONIA
            Euro is ESTER</p>

        <h4>Risk Free Rate</h4>
        <p>usual approach for pricing derivatives is setting up a portfolio that is risk less and arguing the return on the portfolio is the risk free rate.
            The risk free reference rate used is not from treasury due to tax and regulatory factors leading rates to be artificially low. Risk free reference rates are used instead.
        </p>


        <h4>Repo Rates</h4>
        <p>secured borrowing rates in a repurchase agreement, financial institutions are obtaining a loan and the interest it pays is the difference between the price at which the security is sold and the price it is repurchased. The interest rate here is also known as repo rate.
            This works by the lender buying securities from a borrower with the agreement they buy them back at a higher price. This gives protection as if the borrower defaults the lender keeps the securities.
            SOFR is a volume weighted average median of the rates on overnight repo transactions in the USA. This is overnight lending.
            Most common type is overnight repo, but also longer term known as term repos are used.
        </p>

        <h4>Measuring Interest Rates</h4>

        <p>A simple way to measure interest rates is if the rate is 10% and paid annually it is <InlineMath math="\$100 \times 1.1 = 110" />. If the rate is 10% and paid semi annually so 5% every six months then <InlineMath math="\$100 \times 1.05 \times 1.05 = \$110.25" /></p>

        <h2 id={"IRFuture"}>Interest Rate Futures</h2>

        <p>Interest rate futures is a derivative that allows exposure to changes in interest rates. Interest rate futures move inversely to interest rates, if interest rates go down then interest rate futures go up. This is because if the rates go down then the price of bonds will go up, so a trader would lock in a future price on the current interest rate and execute when the interest rates go down. A fuller definition can be read on [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/why-interest-rates-have-inverse-relationship-bond-prices/). They can be used for speculation or hedging. The rates used for the interest rate differ from the bond future rates and also they are cash settled compared to bonds that deliver the bond. </p>

        <h3>Properties of Stock Options</h3>

        <p>There are six factors that affect the price of stock options. These are the current stock price, the strike price, the time to expiration, the volatility of the stock price, the risk free interest rate and the dividends that are expected to be paid. Changes to each of these impact the option price in a increase, decrease or an unclear way.</p>

        <p>Current stock price can increase this would increase the price of the call option, decrease the price of the put option for both American and European options. If the strike price increase then the call price options value decrease and the put increase for both European and American options. The time to expiration increase has an unknown impact on European options due to the fixed exercise date but have increases in price for American options as you can exercise at any point in that timeframe. Volatility increases will increase the price for all call and put options due to the increased changes of significant movements in the stock. When the risk free rate increases the price of call options increase and put options decrease. The risk free rate is used in option pricing represents the return from a risk free investment over the same time period. Depending on the ex-dividend date and where it falls with the expiration will impact the price of the option if it will be included to the owner of the stack as the seller or buyer.</p>

        <p>Options have bounds for example call options give the buyer the right to buy one share of a stock for a certain price. No matter what happens the option can never be worth more than the stock. Therefore the stock price is the upper bound to the option price. </p>

        <h3>Stochastic Processes</h3>
        <p>Any variable whose value changes over time in an uncertain way is said to follow a stochastic process. Stochastic processes can be either continuous time or discrete time. A discrete time stochastic process is one where the variable value can change only at certain fixed points. A continuous time stochastic process is when the value can change at any time. They can also be discrete variable or continuous variable where the discrete variable can only take certain discrete values and continuous can have any value in a specific range. For stock prices are restricted to discrete variable as they have a range of cents and discrete time as the stock market opens and closes. </p>

        <h3>Markov Property</h3>

          <p>The Markov process is a stochastic process where only the current value of a variable is relevant in predicting the future. Stock prices are usually assumed to follow a Markov process. Therefore if a stock is Â£50 now this is the only relevant piece of information for Markov processes for predicting the future value. The Markov property states that the probability distributions of hte price at any particular future time is not dependent on the particular path followed by the price in the past. <strong>Weak form efficiency</strong> states that past prices, historical values and trends cannot predict future prices [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/032615/what-are-differences-between-weak-strong-and-semistrong-versions-efficient-market-hypothesis.asp). This means that the current price of a stock contains all the information contained in a a record of past prices.</p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       <p></p>

            <h3>Dividends</h3>
            <p>The payment of dividends for stocks can impact prices. Stocks will usually fall by the dividend amount on the ex-dividend date. This is the first day of trading where an upcoming dividend payment is not included in a stocks price. Call options are less expensive leading up to ex-dividend date due to expected fall in underlying stock whilst a put option is more expensive due to the same expected drop.</p>

            <p>You can then formulate the dividend for absolute dividends as the Spot Price after ex-dividend date is the Spot Price before the ex-dividend date subtract the dividend payment size. Dividends can be continuous or discrete they are usually discrete for a single stock where they are paid at fixed dates. For indexes however you can get multiple payments of dividends from the different stocks that make up the index this is more aligned to continuous.</p>

            <p>Proportional dividend is a portion of the close value of the stock on the day previous to the ex-dividend date. For example if the stock has a close of $20 and a dividend of $1 then the dividend represents 5% of the total. Therefore all previous values are reduced by 5%. Opposed to the absolute method where all previous dates would be reduced by $1.</p>

            <p>Implied dividends is a market forecast about the amount of a dividend payment.</p>
